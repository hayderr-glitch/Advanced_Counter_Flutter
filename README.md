An enhanced, beautifully styled counter application built with Flutter. This project goes beyond a simple counter by adding features like custom increment/decrement amounts, a unique earthy color theme, and various UI customizations.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Add & Subtract:** Increment or decrement the counter with dedicated buttons.
*   **Custom Amount:** Use the text field to specify the exact amount to add or subtract.
*   **Numeric Input Only:** The text field is restricted to accept only digits for a smoother user experience.
*   **Custom Earthy Theme:** A warm and inviting theme using red, orange, gold, and earth tones.
*   **Styled AppBar:** A centered AppBar title with dynamically colored capital letters for a unique look.
*   **Custom Buttons:** The "Subtract" button is styled in red, and the "Add" button is styled in blue for clear visual distinction.
*   **Styled Counter Display:** The main counter number is displayed in italics.
*   **Styled Text Field:** The input field has a light grey background to make it stand-out.
